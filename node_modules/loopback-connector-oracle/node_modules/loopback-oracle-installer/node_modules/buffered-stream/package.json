The content written to the stream is buffered at a defined size and later flushed into the final destination stream. Use the buffered stream to increase writing speed.\n\nQuick example\n-------------\n\nThe example below will buffer the data from i readable stream and send them to a writeable stream as 16 Mo chunks.\n\n```javascript\nbuffered = require('buffered-stream');\n\nreader = createStreamReader();\nbuffer = buffered(4*1024*1024);\nwriter = createStreamWriter();\n\nreader.pipe(buffer).pipe(writer);\n```\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nTests are executed with mocha. To install it, simple run `npm install`, it will install\nmocha and its dependencies in your project \"node_modules\" directory.\n\nTo run the tests:\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\nThe tests run against the CoffeeScript source files.\n\nTo generate the JavaScript files:\n```bash\nmake build\n```\n\nThe test suite is run online with [Travis][travis] against Node.js version 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9.\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n*\t  David Worms: <https://github.com/wdavidw>\n\n[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/#!/wdavidw/node-buffered-stream\n\n",
